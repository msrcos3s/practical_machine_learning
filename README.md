## Synopsis

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, I will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways to predict the manner in which participants will perform a barbell lift.

## Possible Outcomes

The outcome variable is `classe`, a factor variable  with 5 levels of precision in a set of 10 repetitions of Unilateral Dumbbell Curl:

`class A` exactly according to the specification;

`class B` throwing the elbows to the front;

`class C` lifting the dumbbell only halfway;

`class D` lowering the dumbbell only halfway;

`class E` throwing the hips to the front.
